# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Manikanta Neerugatti

Java Full Stack Developer | Spring Boot | Angular | Microservices | AWS

I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable backend systems, responsive front-ends, and cloud-native applications. I love writing clean, reliable code that powers real-world systems â€” from regulatory stock market tools to AI-assisted vulnerability platforms.

Just graduated with master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Houston â€“ Clear Lake (May 2025), I enjoy working on full-stack projects that bring together deep backend logic and modern UI/UX.
